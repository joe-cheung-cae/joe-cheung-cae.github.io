## The Problem with Digital Notes

I've tried dozens of note-taking apps over the years. They all failed me in the same way: **I could never find what I wrote when I needed it**. The friction between capturing and retrieving knowledge was too high.

This blog is my solution—a searchable, tag-based system that mimics how my brain works.

## Core Principles

### 1. Atomic Notes

Each note covers one concept. If I can't explain it in 500 words, I break it down.

**Bad:** "Everything about C++"
**Good:** "C++ Move Semantics"

### 2. Progressive Summarization

I write notes in layers:

1. **Layer 1**: Raw capture (code snippets, quick thoughts)
2. **Layer 2**: Bold the key points
3. **Layer 3**: Highlight the essentials
4. **Layer 4**: Executive summary at the top

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with Layer 1. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. You can always refine later.
</Callout>

### 3. Link Everything

Notes don't exist in isolation. I link related concepts:

- **Up**: Parent concepts (Move Semantics → C++ Performance)
- **Down**: Child concepts (Move Semantics → Perfect Forwarding)
- **Across**: Related ideas (Move Semantics → RAII)

## My Workflow

### Capture Phase

When learning something new:

1. **Immediate**: Jot down in a scratch file
2. **Same day**: Expand into a proper note
3. **Within week**: Refine and connect to existing notes

```

├── code-snippets.cpp
└── links-to-process.md

├── algorithms/
│   ├── quickhull.mdx
│   └── graph-traversal.mdx
└── tools/
    ├── cmake.mdx
    └── git.mdx
```

### Organization

I use a flat structure with heavy tagging:

- **By topic**: `cpp`, `algorithms`, `tools`
- **By language**: `C++`, `Python`, `Rust`
- **By status**: `draft`, `review`, `complete`
- **By depth**: `overview`, `tutorial`, `reference`

### Retrieval

Three ways to find notes:

1. **Search**: Full-text search across all content
2. **Tags**: Browse by topic or language
3. **Links**: Follow connections from related notes

## The PARA Method

I adapt Tiago Forte's PARA system:

| Category | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Projects** | Notes with deadlines | "Implement QuickHull" |
| **Areas** | Ongoing responsibilities | "C++ Performance" |
| **Resources** | Reference material | "CMake Cookbook" |
| **Archive** | Completed/inactive | Old project notes |

## Tools I Use

<Callout type="note">
  The best tool is the one you'll actually use. I built this blog because existing tools didn't match my mental model. Your mileage may vary.
</Callout>

### For This Blog

- **Astro**: Static site generation
- **MDX**: Markdown with React components
- **MiniSearch**: Client-side search
- **Git**: Version control

### For Quick Capture

- **VS Code**: Primary editor
- **GitHub Issues**: Track ideas
- **Physical notebook**: Diagrams and sketches

## Note Templates

### Algorithm Note

```markdown
## Problem
What does this solve?

## Intuition
How would you explain this to a 5-year-old?

## Algorithm
Step-by-step description.

## Complexity
| Case | Time | Space |
|------|------|-------|
| Best | O(n) | O(1) |
| Average | O(n log n) | O(log n) |
| Worst | O(n²) | O(n) |

## Implementation
Key code snippets.

## Variations
Related algorithms and modifications.

## References
Links to papers, videos, articles.
```

### Language Feature Note

```markdown
## What Is It?
One-sentence definition.

## Why Use It?
Benefits and use cases.

## Syntax
Minimal example.

## Deep Dive
How it works under the hood.

## Common Pitfalls
Mistakes to avoid.

## Best Practices
How to use it well.
```

## Weekly Review

Every Sunday, I spend 30 minutes:

1. Process inbox notes
2. Review and refine recent notes
3. Look for connections between notes
4. Identify gaps in my knowledge

## Measuring Success

I know my system works when:

- ✅ I can find a note in under 10 seconds
- ✅ I write notes without friction
- ✅ I revisit and improve old notes
- ✅ I connect ideas across domains

## Conclusion

Good note-taking isn't about capturing everything—it's about **building a personal knowledge base that compounds over time**. Start simple, stay consistent, and let your system evolve with your needs.

The goal isn't perfect notes. The goal is **better thinking**.
